# Developer Documentation

This documentation was generated from the XML comments within the source files. We also have a downloadable CHM file that replicates the MSDN style documentation from Microsoft.

That file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/VirtualPhotonics/VTS/releases/download/Version_8.0/VtsDocumentation.chm)
